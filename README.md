My comments to this third project.

First of all I got some problems when using the local host that is linket in the Spotify app in Spotify pages that had to be made to use that API.
This is because it can not use the same as the Second project - the backend used so I fad to try out a few wasy of doing it before I ended up adding one to Spotify app.
I had localhost:3000 on this project and 8081 on the number 2 project.

I have been working a lot back and forth to get the api's to work, I could not get anything to work through connecting to the backend with setupProxy.js helping to connect them.
So I had to move these folders away so that they are not disturbing the front end.

A lot of script has been done and even more has been deleted.  Alwasy very diffivult to get things to work.
I also send a video of the functions that I got to work.

Site is made on React
I have a login that works
Logout works
The first data you see is only text and boxes but when you make the aearch you get more.
The search function works
First you search for an artist and get image, artist name, genre, popularity.
This info then also pulls into a dropdown box.
Choose an alternative in the box and search for the albums of the one you want.
Then a next dropdown gets the information and you can choose to search for songs in the album.

This song search I could not get the api to work.

This is published on Render.
